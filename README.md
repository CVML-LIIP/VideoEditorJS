Requirements
============

To work properly this project need to run on a web server.
To use it you need to have a recent web-browser. In particaly we recomand Firefox and Google Chrome.
in this project we use a JavaScript build of ffmpeg to get a lot of informations form the multimedia file that the user gave, but it's not included in this repository, you can find it here : https://github.com/bgrins/videoconverter.js/tree/master/build
Finaly the most important thing, you need a server that can execute a static windows or linux ffmpeg binary to make the final video from the editor. Static build can be found here : http://ffmpeg.org/download.html
